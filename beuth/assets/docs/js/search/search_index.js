Endlichen Automaten (DEA). Dabei sollen Sie zunächst\n    zufällige Zeichenketten generieren. Mithilfe des DEA ist es leicht korrekte\n    Zeichenketten zu erstellen. Alternativ lassen sich auch falsche\n    Zeichenketten, die nicht erkannt werden, erzeugen. Modifizieren Sie dazu\n    mithilfe des Automaten eine korrekte Zeichenkette, indem Sie an einer\n    bestimmten Stelle eine fehlerhafte Eingabe anhand einer Kannte, die nicht\n    existiert, erzeugen, und diese gegen die korrekte austauschen. In einem\n    zweiten Schritt prüfen Sie die Eingabe mittels des DEA. ACHTUNG: Sie sollen\n    NICHT die Embedded Reber Grammar (ERG), sondern nur den inneren Teil, die\n    Reber Grammar (RG), betrachten. Anwendung und Abgabe: Es wird eine\n    Web-Anwendung erstellt, siehe Kursplan.\n    \n    \n    Visualisierung:\n    Stellen Sie den DEA als Tabelle und als Graph da. Die Verarbeitung der\n    Eingabe wird schrittweise angezeigt. Schließlich wird das Endzustand und das\n    Ergebnis (erkannt oder nicht erkannt) des Automaten dargestellt. Bei der\n    Umsetzung in HTML gibt es viele Möglichkeiten. Sie können eine SVG Grafik\n    nutzen, Sie könnenden Canvas verwenden, Sie können mit HTML Elementen oder\n    einer Image-Map arbeiten.\n    \n    \n    Interaktion:\n    Man kann in der Anwendung richtige und falsche Zeichenketten als Beispiel\n    erzeugen lassen.

Hier werden bsp.\n\nStart der Animation\nSpeed\nStop\nPause \nusw. \ndefiniert. Der Grammar-Service bekommt hierzu sowohl die RuleSets, als auch die Speed vom Grammar Component.\n\nGrammar Component\nDie GrammarKomponente ist die Kommunikation zwischen dem Service, Model und die View. Hier werden:\n\nDas Model erzeugt und instanziert\nDer Service initialisiert und gesteuert\nDie View upgedated\n\nAlgorithmus + Datestrukturen\nDie Grundidee ist hier die Auslagerung der Business-Logik in dem Exp.Grammar Model. Dieser nimmt die\nRegeln bsp.:\ninterface FourTuple {\n  V: string[];\n  SIG: string[];\n  R: {\n    A: string[];\n    O: string[];\n    Z: string[];\n  };\n  start: string;\n}auf und kann dann mit String-Replace ein neuen Array erzeugen mit folgender Struktur:\nexport class RuleSetInterface {\n  expIndex: number | null;\n  rule: string;\n  prevExp: string;\n  afterExp: string;\n\n  constructor(props?: RuleSetInterface) {\n    this.expIndex = props?.expIndex || 0;\n    this.rule = props?.rule || '';\n    this.prevExp = props?.prevExp || '';\n    this.afterExp = props?.afterExp || '';\n  }\n}Jede Ersetzung entspricht dann ein RuleSetInterface.
