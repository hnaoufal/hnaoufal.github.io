zu diesem Simulator zum\n      Kurs Technische Informatik im SS21.\n    \n    \n    Zum Projekt\n    \n      Dieses Projekt ist im Kurs Technische Informatik unter der Leitung von\n      Prof. Dr. Felix Gers\n      \n        (Link)\n      entstanden.\n    \n    Folgende 4 Projekte sind hier implementiert:\n    \n      Projektaufgabe P1: DEA\n      Projektaufgabe P2: Grammatik\n      Projektaufgabe P3: Kellerautomat\n      Projektaufgabe P4: TM\n    \n    \n    DEA\n    Aufgabenstellung:\n    Simulieren und visualisieren Sie die Reber Grammar (RG) als\n    Deterministischen Endlichen Automaten (DEA). Dabei sollen Sie zunächst\n    zufällige Zeichenketten generieren. Mithilfe des DEA ist es leicht korrekte\n    Zeichenketten zu erstellen. Alternativ lassen sich auch falsche\n    Zeichenketten, die nicht erkannt werden, erzeugen. Modifizieren Sie dazu\n    mithilfe des Automaten eine korrekte Zeichenkette, indem Sie an einer\n    bestimmten Stelle eine fehlerhafte Eingabe anhand einer Kannte, die nicht\n    existiert, erzeugen, und diese gegen die korrekte austauschen. In einem\n    zweiten Schritt prüfen Sie die Eingabe mittels des DEA. ACHTUNG: Sie sollen\n    NICHT die Embedded Reber Grammar (ERG), sondern nur den inneren Teil, die\n    Reber Grammar (RG), betrachten. Anwendung und Abgabe: Es wird eine\n    Web-Anwendung erstellt, siehe Kursplan.\n    \n    \n    Visualisierung:\n    Stellen Sie den DEA als Tabelle und als Graph da. Die Verarbeitung der\n    Eingabe wird schrittweise angezeigt. Schließlich wird das Endzustand und das\n    Ergebnis (erkannt oder nicht erkannt) des Automaten dargestellt. Bei der\n    Umsetzung in HTML gibt es viele Möglichkeiten. Sie können eine SVG Grafik\n    nutzen, Sie könnenden Canvas verwenden, Sie können mit HTML Elementen oder\n    einer Image-Map arbeiten.\n    \n    \n    Interaktion:\n    Man kann in der Anwendung richtige und falsche Zeichenketten als Beispiel\n    erzeugen lassen. Auch die Eingabe einer Zeichenkette ist möglich. Diese kann\n    dann schrittweise oder automatisch animiert verarbeitet werden. Die\n    Animationsgeschwindigkeit ist einstellbar.\n    \n    \n    Gestaltung:\n    Achten Sie auf eine sinnvolle Semantik bei der Farbgestaltung und ein\n    übersichtliches Layout. Beachten Sie die Human/Mensch-Computer-Interaction\n    (HCI) Kriterien beim Interaktionsdesign: ISO 9241-11 Anforderungen an die\n    Gebrauchstauglichkeit und ISO 9241-110 Grundsätze der Dialoggestaltung:\n    https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9241. Ihre Anwendung sollte funktional\n    (Aufgabenangemessenheit) und benutzerfreundlich (Usability) und mit\n    angemessenem Feedback und einer [kontextsensitive] Hilfe ausgestattet sein.\n    \n    Grammatik\n    Aufgabenstellung:\n    Erzeugen Sie mit Hilfe eine Grammatik zufällige arithmetische Ausdrücke über einstelligen natürlichen Zahlen mit den Operanden \"+,-,*,/\" und beliebig geschachtelten runden Klammeren, z.B.: 2*(3*(4+7)-9) oder 9+2 oder (3) oder nur 7 sind gültig, ungültig sind 12 oder () oder (+3) oder -1. Nutzen Sie die folgenden Abkürzungen: A = Ausdruck, O = Operator = + | - | * | / ,  Z = Zahl/Ziffer = 0 | 1| 2| ... | 9.\n    Es sollt auch möglich sein einen [wahrscheinlich] fehlerhaften Ausdruck zu erzeugen. Dazu löschen Sie einfach ein beliebiges Zeichen aus dem Ausdruck und kontrollieren das Resultat  Diese Kontrolle erfolgt direct in JS, z.B. mittels eval. Denn es lässt sich mittels einer Grammatik schwer nachweisen, dass man einen Ausdruck nicht erzeugen kann.\n    \n    \n    Visualisierung:\n    Die Generierung der Ausdrücke mittels der Grammatik wird schrittweise angezeigt. Dabei soll ersichtlich sein welche Regel angewandt wird. Sie können dabei mit Text [und CSS] als Darstellung arbeiten.\n    \n    \n    Interaktion:\n    Die Erzeugung kann schrittweise nachvollzogen oder automatisch animiert werden. Die Animationsgeschwindigkeit ist einstellbar.\n    \n    \n    Dokumentation:\n    Nutzen Sie eine separate HTML Seite, die über ein Link/Button von Ihrer Anwendung aus erreichbar ist, zur Dokumentation.\n\n    Technisch: Listen Sie alle verwendeten Frameworks auf und erklären Sie kurz (1-3 Sätze) wozu Sie diese verwenden.

Zum Projekt          Dieses Projekt ist im Kurs Technische Informatik unter der Leitung von      Prof. Dr. Felix Gers              (Link)      entstanden.        Folgende 4 Projekte sind hier implementiert:          Projektaufgabe P1: DEA      Projektaufgabe P2: Grammatik      Projektaufgabe P3: Kellerautomat      Projektaufgabe P4: TM            DEA    Aufgabenstellung:    Simulieren und visualisieren Sie die Reber Grammar (RG) als    Deterministischen Endlichen Automaten (DEA). Dabei sollen Sie zunächst    zufällige Zeichenketten generieren. Mithilfe des DEA ist es leicht korrekte    Zeichenketten zu erstellen. Alternativ lassen sich auch falsche    Zeichenketten, die nicht erkannt werden, erzeugen. Modifizieren Sie dazu    mithilfe des Automaten eine korrekte Zeichenkette, indem Sie an einer    bestimmten Stelle eine fehlerhafte Eingabe anhand einer Kannte, die nicht    existiert, erzeugen, und diese gegen die korrekte austauschen. In einem    zweiten Schritt prüfen Sie die Eingabe mittels des DEA. ACHTUNG: Sie sollen    NICHT die Embedded Reber Grammar (ERG), sondern nur den inneren Teil, die    Reber Grammar (RG), betrachten. Anwendung und Abgabe: Es wird eine    Web-Anwendung erstellt, siehe Kursplan.            Visualisierung:    Stellen Sie den DEA als Tabelle und als Graph da. Die Verarbeitung der    Eingabe wird schrittweise angezeigt. Schließlich wird das Endzustand und das    Ergebnis (erkannt oder nicht erkannt) des Automaten dargestellt. Bei der    Umsetzung in HTML gibt es viele Möglichkeiten. Sie können eine SVG Grafik    nutzen, Sie könnenden Canvas verwenden, Sie können mit HTML Elementen oder    einer Image-Map arbeiten.            Interaktion:    Man kann in der Anwendung richtige und falsche Zeichenketten als Beispiel    erzeugen lassen. Auch die Eingabe einer Zeichenkette ist möglich. Diese kann    dann schrittweise oder automatisch animiert verarbeitet werden. Die    Animationsgeschwindigkeit ist einstellbar.            Gestaltung:    Achten Sie auf eine sinnvolle Semantik bei der Farbgestaltung und ein    übersichtliches Layout. Beachten Sie die Human/Mensch-Computer-Interaction    (HCI) Kriterien beim Interaktionsdesign: ISO 9241-11 Anforderungen an die    Gebrauchstauglichkeit und ISO 9241-110 Grundsätze der Dialoggestaltung:    https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9241. Ihre Anwendung sollte funktional    (Aufgabenangemessenheit) und benutzerfreundlich (Usability) und mit    angemessenem Feedback und einer [kontextsensitive] Hilfe ausgestattet sein.        Grammatik    Aufgabenstellung:    Erzeugen Sie mit Hilfe eine Grammatik zufällige arithmetische Ausdrücke über einstelligen natürlichen Zahlen mit den Operanden \"+,-,*,/\" und beliebig geschachtelten runden Klammeren, z.B.: 2*(3*(4+7)-9) oder 9+2 oder (3) oder nur 7 sind gültig, ungültig sind 12 oder () oder (+3) oder -1. Nutzen Sie die folgenden Abkürzungen: A = Ausdruck, O = Operator = + | - | * | / ,  Z = Zahl/Ziffer = 0 | 1| 2| ... | 9.    Es sollt auch möglich sein einen [wahrscheinlich] fehlerhaften Ausdruck zu erzeugen. Dazu löschen Sie einfach ein beliebiges Zeichen aus dem Ausdruck und kontrollieren das Resultat  Diese Kontrolle erfolgt direct in JS, z.B. mittels eval. Denn es lässt sich mittels einer Grammatik schwer nachweisen, dass man einen Ausdruck nicht erzeugen kann.            Visualisierung:    Die Generierung der Ausdrücke mittels der Grammatik wird schrittweise angezeigt. Dabei soll ersichtlich sein welche Regel angewandt wird. Sie können dabei mit Text [und CSS] als Darstellung arbeiten.            Interaktion:    Die Erzeugung kann schrittweise nachvollzogen oder automatisch animiert werden. Die Animationsgeschwindigkeit ist einstellbar.            Dokumentation:    Nutzen Sie eine separate HTML Seite, die über ein Link/Button von Ihrer Anwendung aus erreichbar ist, zur Dokumentation.    Technisch: Listen Sie alle verwendeten Frameworks auf und erklären Sie kurz (1-3 Sätze) wozu Sie diese verwenden. Dokumentieren Sie technische Besonderheiten Ihrer Lösung.    Fachlich: Erläutern Sie Ihre Implementierung der Logik. Wie haben Sie den Automaten bzw. die Grammatik im Code umgesetzt: Datenstrukturen und Algorithmus.            Gestaltung:    Achten Sie auf eine sinnvolle Semantik bei der Farbgestaltung und ein übersichtliches Layout.

Dazu löschen Sie einfach ein beliebiges Zeichen aus dem Ausdruck und kontrollieren das Resultat  Diese Kontrolle erfolgt direct in JS, z.B. mittels eval.

Komponenten\n1.1 GrammarModel Interface\nDas GrammarModel ist ein Interface, aus dem dann verschiedene Grammatiken erben können.\n1.2 ExpressionGrammarModel\nNach dem Prinzip von Fat-Model, Skinny Controllers befindet sich hier die meiste Business-Logik. \nDie Hauptaufgabe des ExpressionGrammarModel, welcher von GrammarModel erbt, ist die Implementierung\nder Logik für die Ausdrücke.\nEine Besonderheit ist hier, dass man die Regeln wie Start, Terminalzeichen, usw. im constructor angeben muss.\nMit Hilfe dieser Regeln, kann die Klasse dann arbeiten.\nDie wichtigsten Attribute und Funktion:\n\ngenerateCorrectExpression -> erzeugt einen richtigen Ausdruck\ngenerateWrongExpression -> erzeugt einen falschen Ausdruck\nRuleSet -> Ein Objekt, welches die Regel, vorherige Exp und upgedated Exp. enthaelt\n\n1.3 GrammarService\nDie Hauptaufgabe des Grammar-Services ist die ganze Steuerung des Grammar-Modules. Hier werden bsp.\n\nStart der Animation\nSpeed\nStop\nPause \nusw. \ndefiniert. Der Grammar-Service bekommt hierzu sowohl die RuleSets, als auch die Speed vom Grammar Component.\n\n1.4 Grammar Component\nDie GrammarKomponente ist die Kommunikation zwischen dem Service, Model und die View. Hier werden:\n\nDas Model erzeugt und instanziert\nDer Service initialisiert und gesteuert\nDie View upgedated\n\n2. Algorithmus + Datestrukturen\n2.1 Die Erzeugung eines Korrekten Ausdrucks\nDie Grundidee ist hier die Auslagerung der Business-Logik in dem Exp.Grammar Model. Dieser nimmt die\nRegel, auf der dann Ausdrücke erzeugt werden, bsp.:\ninterface FourTuple {\n  V: string[];\n  SIG: string[];\n  R: {\n    A: string[];\n    O: string[];\n    Z: string[];\n  };\n  start: string;\n}Mit der String-Replace Methode wird dann ein neuer Array erzeugt mit folgender Struktur:\nexport class RuleSetInterface {\n  expIndex: number | null;\n  rule: string;\n  prevExp: string;\n  afterExp: string;\n\n  constructor(props?: RuleSetInterface) {\n    this.expIndex = props?.expIndex || 0;\n    this.rule = props?.rule || '';\n    this.prevExp = props?.prevExp || '';\n    this.afterExp = props?.afterExp || '';\n  }\n}Jede Ersetzung entspricht dann ein RuleSet basierend auf dem o.g. Interface. Dieser Prozess wird solange widerholt, bis\nkein Nicht-Terminalzeichen mehr im String vorhanden ist.\nwhile (this._hasNonTerminalChar(exp)) {\n  ...\n}Mit der JS Funktion eval wird das Ergebnis des Ausdrucks dann bei Auswertung: angezeigt.\nDer Grammar-Service fungiert als Observable für die Grammar-Komponente und übergibt somit diesen Array zur Animation.\n2.2 Die Erzeugung eines Falschen Ausdrucks\nEs wird wie in 2.1 ein richtiger Ausdruck erzeugt. Danach wird nach einem Random Algorithmus ein Zeichen ausgetauscht.\n2.3 Die Validierung des Ausdrucks\nHier wird der Ausdruck mit zwei Verfahren validiert:\nValidierung mit Eval\nDer Ausdruck wird mit eval validiert. Zudem werden negative Zahlen und Zahlendopplungen ausgeschlossen (Diese wuerden durch Eval ein False-Positive ergeben)\n  public isExpressionValid(exp: string): number {\n    let result;\n\n    if (matchDoubleD || _isNegNumber(exp)) {\n      this._valid = false;\n    } else {\n      try {\n        result = eval(exp);\n        this.value = Number.parseFloat(result);\n        this._valid = true;\n      } catch {\n        this._valid = false;\n      }\n    }\n\n    return result;\n  }Validierung mit Reverser Logik\nHierzu wird der String-Replace Algorithmus umgekehrt angewendet, bis dann nur noch A steht (rictig) oder exp !== 'A' (falsch).\nDiese Methode wird auch animiert.\n2.4 Animation\nDa Animation in diesem Projekt haeufig angewendet werden, wurde ein spezielle Animations-Logik implementiert. Das Schema sieht so aus:\nexport const grammarAnimation = ['', '2', '3'].map((v) =>\n  trigger(`onVisible${v}`, [\n    transition(':enter', [\n      animate(\n        '{{speed1}}s 0s ease-in-out',\n        keyframes([\n          style({ transform: 'translateY(-30%)', color: 'black', opacity: 0 }),\n          style({ transform: 'translateY(0%)', color: 'black', opacity: 1 }),\n        ])\n      ),\n      animate(\n        '{{speed2}}s 0s ease-in-out',\n        keyframes([style({ color: 'blue', 'font-weight': 'bold' }), style({ color: 'black', 'font-weight': 'normal' })])\n      ),\n    ]),\n    transition(':leave', [\n      animate(\n        '0.2s 0s ease-out',\n        keyframes([\n          style({ transform: 'translateY(0%)', opacity: 1 }),\n          style({ transform: 'translateY(-30%)', opacity: 0 }),\n        ])\n      ),\n    ]),\n  ])\n);2.5 Manuelle Eingabe\nLaeuft wie das generieren der Ausdrucke uber den Validator, der den Ausdruck validiert.\nWeitere Details\nFuer weitere Details bitte in der Navigation schauen.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        Kein passendes Ergebnis \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
